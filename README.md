# Github-Static-Security-Analyzer

The GitHub Repository Analyzer is a sophisticated tool aimed at enhancing the security and integrity of projects hosted on GitHub. By integrating with GitHub's GraphQL API and the Bandit static code analyzer, this Python-based application delivers a comprehensive analysis of Python code and dependencies within a repository, identifying potential vulnerabilities and coding issues.

## Features

- **Security Vulnerability Detection:** Scans for known vulnerabilities in repository dependencies based on GitHub's vulnerability database.
- **Static Code Analysis:** Utilizes Bandit to identify common security issues in Python code, such as improper input validation, insecure usage of cryptography, and more.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface with support for both dark and light modes, enhancing the user experience.
- **Customizable Reports:** Generates detailed reports on identified issues, allowing for easy prioritization and remediation.
